I: I want a chatbot that can learn from daily use.
I want a bot that can use simple text as a start point

Design:
horst suggests I use a db
Can go with 100s of if then statements
can go with chatterbot connectd to spacy


the chatbot runs in the browser so I can edit the output and save it 
at the same time.

ideas: maybe Flask will help me set up an instance that will allow
for to 'remain listening'
