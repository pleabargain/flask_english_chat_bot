# flask_english_chat_bot

# notes
check out db browser for sqlite

## to run the chatbot
build it first with python3 

chatbot_training.py

this will load your local training data  in the training_data directory

Then the code will prompt you to download the NEARLY useless chatterbot database. I say nearly useless because chatterbot does NOT randomize the responses at all! The so called training will only ever return the first training and nothing else. :(

then run

python3 working.flaskchatbot.py
